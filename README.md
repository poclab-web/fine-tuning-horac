# Title
Predicting Hydrophilic Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity Using Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

# Abstruct
In recent years, obtaining sufficient labeling data for time-consuming measurements or samples that contain target substrates in limited quantities has become more difficult. One example is the measurement of antioxidant capacity. Methods such as transfer learning and fine-tuning are effective in such cases. In this study, a model for predicting the hydrophilic oxygen radical absorption capacity was created by calculating bond dissociation enthalpy related to the reaction of antioxidants by creating a pre-training model and fine-tuning it. Using this method, we were able to improve the generalization performance of the prediction model.
